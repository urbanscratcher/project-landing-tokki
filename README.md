## Libraries & Technologies
- Implementation: HTML, CSS (SASS), TypeScript
  - Used SASS in the form of CSS modules
  - Used BEM naming convention to compare with TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, etc.
    - In conclusion, breaking down into components led to too much fine-grained division, which was inefficient.
    - However, it was more convenient than pure CSS because it allows styling with variables and functions and writing in a nested structure.
- Framework: Next.js 13
  - Although not necessary for a landing page, I used it to study Next.js and learn about the Image Optimization in version 13.
- Deployment: Vercel

## Development Process
- Discovered a PDF brochure of the favorite brand 'Tokki Soju' and used it as a basis to create the landing page.
- Focused on implementing various patterns that appear on landing pages in different sections rather than special features.
- The skeleton was constructed using UI kits in Figma, and fonts and primary colors were chosen to match the brand's character.
- Even though it was an overspec for a personal project, I used various technologies I wanted to learn. Due to the lack of restrictions and simple tasks, I was able to experiment a lot.
- This project helped me get familiar with CSS and HTML structuring, but the tricky parts were the Carousel Slide, modal implementation, and mobile menu transformation.
- In terms of absolute amount, I spent the most time on design considerations. Even when working alone, separating design (planning) and coding processes seems more efficient than coding while designing.
- While studying Atomic Design, I tried dividing components into atoms, molecules, organisms, etc., but it was not very intuitive. Dividing into presentational components and functional components seemed better.
